Phase 2 in progress: nav model wired to a real `ViewerContext` driven by a
server `getSession()` seam + the Next router; `/overview` dashboard live; real
product surfaces built on the M6 layouts + shared data-display (`StatusBadge` /
`ScheduleGrid` / `Meter`) — the full Students area, Attendance
(`/attendance/daily`), the Classes area (timetable · subjects · gradebook), the
Finance area (invoices · payments · reports), the Settings area, and now the
**Reports** area (`/reports/academic` · `/reports/analytics`). Every M6 layout
pattern is exercised in-app, and the `[...slug]` placeholder no longer backs any
shipped section. See the Phase 2 session summaries in `AI_HANDOFF.md`.

Latest session (2026-06-20 pt.3 — backend assessment + tenant isolation enforced):
Did a deep backend assessment (`apps/api` NestJS is a real auth/RBAC/academic
core) and **fixed the #1 gap — tenant data isolation was not actually enforced**.
Now enforced at the DB via **Postgres RLS on 23 tables** + a restricted
`app_runtime` role + an audited `app.is_platform` bypass, **proven** by
`packages/database/prisma/scripts/rls-isolation-check.sql` (cross-tenant
read/insert/update/delete all blocked). Also denormalized `tenant_id` onto child
tables (+ backfill), added tenant-leading composite indexes, parameterized the
RLS setter, hardened the `withTenant` extension (+11 unit tests), and made it a
**self-enforcing standard**: CI guard `db:rls:check` (fails the build on an
unguarded tenant table), `ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`, and `enforce_tenant_rls()`.
See `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` ADR-004, `docs/tenant-isolation-plan.md`, and the
ordered **`docs/backend-remediation-plan.md`**. The one piece left on isolation is
the **runtime cutover** (app → `app_runtime`) = Step 1 below.

> ▶ **Next session: start with `docs/backend-remediation-plan.md`** — the backend
> gaps from the assessment are ordered into sequential, pick-up-able steps
> (Step 1 = RLS runtime cutover; then CI; then frontend↔backend auth wiring;
> then attendance, finance, polymorphism, tests).

Prior session (2026-06-20 pt.2 — chart-wrapper tests + DonutChart 2nd surface + StatGrid tests):
**(1)** Tested the last untested `packages/ui` family, the recharts chart
wrappers. Added a shared jsdom stub `packages/ui/src/test/recharts-mock.tsx`
(`withFixedResponsiveContainer` swaps recharts' `ResponsiveContainer` — which
measures via `ResizeObserver`, absent in jsdom — for a fixed 800×400 passthrough);
each chart test applies it via `vi.mock('recharts', …)`. New suites:
`donut-chart.test.tsx` (5), `trend-chart.test.tsx` (6), `category-bar-chart.test.tsx`
(5). **(2)** Gave `DonutChart` a **second** consumer: `/reports/analytics` now
shows an enrolment-by-level split; the page bottom was restructured (funnel
full-width, then a 2-col row of donut + capacity `Meter`). **(3)** Added
`custom/layouts/stat-grid.test.tsx` (8 — tile count, `minTileWidth`, div/link/button
render modes + `onSelect` click, `hint`, delta tone by intent + by direction).
UI now **72 tests** / 8 files. Verified: UI 72/72 ✅ (Node 22) · `packages/ui`
`tsc -p` ✅ · web check-types ✅ · web lint ✅ · web 13/13 ✅ (Node 20.18) · web build ✅.

> ⚠ The jsdom (component) suite requires **Node ≥20.19** — the same threshold the
> repo `engines` + the `@workspace/database` build already need. Run UI tests
> under `nvm` v22; the resolver + web suites still pass on the default 20.18.

Prior session (2026-06-20 pt.1 — lint fix + DonutChart 1st consumer + ScheduleGrid tests):
cleared the pre-existing `web` lint failure (raw `<a>` → next/link `<Link>` in
`app/design-system/*`), gave `DonutChart` its first consumer (fee-status split on
`/finance/reports`), and added `schedule-grid.test.tsx` (9 cases). See
`AI_HANDOFF.md`.

Earlier session (2026-06-18 — Nav resolver tests): finished wiring the shared
runner (`@workspace/vitest-config` had an empty `src`) and added the first suite
— `packages/ui/src/lib/navigation.test.ts`, **26 cases** over `canAccess` /
`isRouteActive` / `resolveNavigation` / `findActiveNavItem`. The Reports session
before it built the chart wrappers (`TrendChart` / `CategoryBarChart`); see
`AI_HANDOFF.md`.

**Git state:** branch `claude` is on `origin`
(`https://github.com/Ewosoft-Solutions/claude-trial.git`, HTTPS). All accumulated
Phase 2 work is **committed and pushed** to `origin/claude`. **PR #1 is OPEN**
(`claude` → `main`, https://github.com/Ewosoft-Solutions/claude-trial/pull/1) and
tracks the whole branch — its title/body were refreshed 2026-06-20 to cover the
Reports area, chart wrappers, DonutChart consumers, and the test suite. Push new
work to `claude` and it lands in PR #1 automatically; keep the PR body current.

Read first:

- AI_CONTEXT.md · AI_HANDOFF.md · CURRENT_PHASE.md (Phase 2)
- implementation-roadmap.md + requirements/ docs for the target area
- packages/ui/README.md (how to consume the foundation + Known Gaps)
- **`apps/api`** — the real NestJS backend (auth / RBAC / MFA / maker-checker /
  audit / tenant), DB-backed via `packages/database` (Prisma). The frontend does
  not consume it yet. (`packages/api` is a separate service *library* — not the
  HTTP app.)
- **`docs/backend-remediation-plan.md`** — the ordered backend steps (START HERE).
- **`ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` ADR-004** + `docs/tenant-isolation-plan.md` —
  tenant isolation design, the RLS standard, and the runtime-cutover runbook.

> ⚠ **Phase numbering is overloaded.** The internal roadmap / `CURRENT_PHASE.md`
> use Phase 1 = design-system foundation, Phase 2 = dashboard infra (where we are).
> The product `requirements/PRD.md` §11 uses different numbers (Phase 1 = core
> platform, Phase 2 = PWA/ops, Phase 3 = AI). Same word, different scales — say
> which when it matters.

Next tasks — work through **ALL** of `docs/backend-remediation-plan.md` in order.
This is the committed backend backlog, **not a pick-one menu**: complete each step
to its acceptance criteria, commit, then move to the next, until every gap is
closed. It is a multi-session effort — do not stop after one step.

1. ✅ **RLS runtime cutover (Step 1) — COMPLETE in code.** Two-client design
   (`TenantDbService.runScoped` on the app_runtime client + GUC + ALS), global
   `RlsTenantInterceptor` + `@TenantScoped`, scoped-or-privileged `client` getter;
   `PrismaTransactionService` reuses the request scope so transactional writes are
   RLS-enforced too. **All tenant-data services migrated** (communication,
   students, academic-structure, assessment-grading, reporting-analytics) + 9
   controllers `@TenantScoped`. Proven: DI 6/6 + HTTP 5/5; `db:rls:check` + build
   green. **Only remaining**: set `APP_RUNTIME_DATABASE_URL` (app_runtime role) in
   each deploy env — operational, documented in `env.*.template`.
2. **CI pipeline (Step 2)** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` with a Postgres service:
   `migrate deploy` → `db:rls:check` → type-check / lint / build / tests. Makes
   the isolation standard and the "must compile/lint/type-check" rule enforced.
3. **Frontend↔backend auth slice (Step 3)** — replace mock `getSession()`
   (`apps/web/lib/session.ts`) with real `apps/api` `/auth/login` → `/select-school`
   → `/refresh`; contract-test the payload vs the `Session` shape. (Not blocked —
   the backend is `apps/api`, DB-backed.)
4. **Attendance domain (Step 4)** — model + API + wire `/attendance/*` (no backend yet).
5. **Finance/billing domain (Step 5)** — model + API + wire `/finance/*` (no backend yet).
6. **Realize polymorphism (Step 6)** — `schoolType`-driven nav + feature-toggle backing.
7. **Backend tests + hygiene (Step 7)** — auth e2e, in-app isolation test,
   `packages/api`↔`apps/api` boundary, stop tracking build artifacts.
8. **Remaining operational modules (Step 8)** — transport/library/health/HR/
   admissions/events, phased; each follows the RLS checklist.

Definition of done for this backlog: Steps 1–7 complete (8 is phased), every gap
in the scorecard closed or explicitly deferred, `db:rls:check` + CI green.

Also ongoing: **keep PR #1 current** (`claude` → `main`, open, tracks the branch)
and refresh its body when you push notable work.

Parallel/independent UI option (not backend): more `packages/ui` coverage —
page-level resolution in `apps/web` or shell/layout components (`PageHeader`,
`AppShell`, `SettingsLayout`, `DashboardLayout`); reuse the jsdom recharts stub
`packages/ui/src/test/recharts-mock.tsx`.

Requirements:

- Reuse `packages/ui` components; build new shared UI in `packages/ui` first.
- Pass type-check, lint, and build before considering complete.
- Update `AI_HANDOFF.md` when done, and refresh this `NEXT_RECOMMENDED_PROMPT.md`.

Note: the preview launcher is blocked by macOS TCC (see Known Issues). The
default `web` launch config serves a self-contained build from `/tmp` on **port
3013**; after editing source, rebuild + re-copy to `/tmp` and restart
`preview_start web` (steps in Known Issues), or grant Documents access and use
`web-pnpm`. Infra caveats that persist and are NOT from this work:
`pnpm --filter @workspace/ui lint` fails on a stale `eslint` symlink
(`eslint@9.39.1` linked but `9.39.4` installed — UI source is covered by `tsc`);
and `pnpm build` (turbo, whole repo) fails on `@workspace/database` (Prisma
`ERR_REQUIRE_ESM` under Node 20.18 < required 20.19) — build `apps/web` directly
instead. **Run tests under Node ≥20.19** (e.g. `nvm` v22): the `@workspace/ui`
jsdom suite needs it (so does the repo `engines`); the one `apps/api` Jest
failure (`permission.service.spec.ts`) is pre-existing and unrelated.
